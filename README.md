This code outlines a comprehensive approach to analyzing Yelp reviews using text classification. It begins by exploring the dataset to identify review lengths and the distribution of star ratings. After cleaning the text data by removing punctuation and stopwords, it applies CountVectorizer to convert text into a bag-of-words model. The Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is then trained on the dataset to predict review ratings, with performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score evaluated. Additionally, TF-IDF transformation is employed to enhance feature representation by reflecting word importance across the corpus. The process demonstrates effective methods for sentiment analysis and model evaluation in text data.
